Entire project designed during Swiggy hackathon 2018

## Supply chain for restaurants

### Problem statement

The users of the Swiggy delivery application always have restaurant information as a single source of trust. They are provided limited information in the restaurant to decide on the quality of the food. People are often made to pay a variable amount for the order in different restaurants without actually justifying it, although there might be a reason for the pricing.



### Solution

* A high amount of transparency can be only be provided with a public, decentralized environment sharing information with each other. 

* We propose a solution by building a supply chain of food ingredients between the entities in a public blockchain.
